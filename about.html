                    I am an experienced, knowledgeable and dedicated Paralegal. I am the sole proprietor of this firm
                    and have many years experience in law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have dedicated my life to helping others in many forms. I have helped many less-fortunate
                    individuals to achieve their goals; I volunteer much of my free time to services and charities
                    provided by the community and have dedicated many more years to providing palliative care to
                    end-of-life patients.
                    I have built many cherished, meaningful and lifelong relationship. I continue to support the
                    homeless, families, children and animals in need, including those who suffer from mental illnesses.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In my previous career I was a Certified Natural Healthcare practitioner on a quest to help to find
                    medical alternatives to illness and disease that arose in my family. We rid my grandmother of cancer
                    - in addition to many other successes in that field. I eventually moved on in my career and turned
                    my attention to law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I became a legal practitioner with the intention of attending law school and becoming a lawyer. My
                    desire was to work in family law. I took the LSO approved college course and wrote the exam to be
                    licensed with the Law Society of Ontario. I became employed with a law firm right out of college and
                    have been working in family law and with the Office of the Children’s Lawyer ever since.
                    Unfortunately, this gave me enough insight to know Family Law was not something I desired to do for
                    the rest of my working career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was during that time I decided to continue helping people in ways, that are generally deemed
                    ‘less insignificant’ to justify hiring a lawyer, yet are still important and difficult enough, that
                    a legal representative is necessary. I decided to stay put where I am and specialize in these areas
                    of law.
                </p>
